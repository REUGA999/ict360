        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I am a developer, with a passion for Coding and Developing Sites with stunning designs. I have been working
            in this field since last 3 years and during this period I have been fortunate enough to work for some of the
            best known local buisness owners and entrepreneurs. Currently I am working as a freelancer as it gives me
            freedom to work on my own as well as gives me enough time to persue my degree. My passion for web
            development started when I was 12 years old. Since then no looking back. Feel free to consult me if you need
            any of my servieces.</p>
